# Accessibility Report
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.


## Principles of Universal Design:

- Principle 1: Equitable Use
    - App is available for anyone to use, and works the same for any person.
    - No feature of the app discriminates against any specific demographic
- Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
    - App offers a variety of features, such as restaurant locating, posting reviews, recipe sharing, meal photo posting, connecting with other users, etc, so users can choose which ones they want to engage with, based on their preferences and needs.
- Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
    - App layout is simple and easy to navigate, with familiar icons and clear labels. Most users can easily use basic features without a steep learning curve.
    - Example feature: the menu bar at the bottom of many views contains familiar icons instead of words, and leads to the core features of the app. This ensures that any user can easily and intuitively access the app's core features. In addition, this menu bar stays consistent between core views, so the user does not need to adjust to unnecessary changes between views.
- Principle 4: Perceptible Information
    - App uses a simple, consistent colour scheme with high contrast, readable fonts, and simple icons.
    - The app has a main colour palette of red, white, and black. This keeps the colour scheme simple and keeps the core colours used distinguishable from each other.
- Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
    - Low consequences for unintended actions; App handles unexpected input well, without crashing the program or causing issues.
    - Example feature: When a user enters a username to follow, the application effectively handles the case where no account with that username exists, the case where the account exists but is private, and the case where the user is already following that account.
- Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
    - Users can use the app at their own pace, with minimal effort.
    - Example feature: The home page shows two columns of posts instead of one, so that the user is able to view more content with minimal scrolling required.
- Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
    - Future features to implement: We want to implement the ability to resize the screen, keeping the layout of views consistent. This will allow the app to run well on any size screen, accomodating users who use significantly smaller or larger screens.
