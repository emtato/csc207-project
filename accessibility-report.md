# Accessibility Report
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.


## Principles of Universal Design:

- Principle 1: Equitable Use
    - App is available for anyone to use, and works the same for any person.
    - No feature of the app discriminates against any specific demographic
- Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
    - App offers a variety of features, such as restaurant locating, posting reviews, recipe sharing, meal photo posting, connecting with other users, etc, so users can choose which ones they want to engage with, based on their preferences and needs.
- Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
    - App layout is simple and easy to navigate, with familiar icons and clear labels. Most users can easily use basic features without a steep learning curve.
    - Example feature: the menu bar at the bottom of many views contains familiar icons instead of words, and leads to the core features of the app. This ensures that any user can easily and intuitively access the app's core features. In addition, this menu bar stays consistent between core views, so the user does not need to adjust to unnecessary changes between views.
- Principle 4: Perceptible Information
    - App uses a simple, consistent colour scheme with high contrast, readable fonts, and simple icons.
    - The app has a main colour palette of red, white, and black. This keeps the colour scheme simple and keeps the core colours used distinguishable from each other.
- Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
    - Low consequences for unintended actions; App handles unexpected input well, without crashing the program or causing issues.
    - Example feature: When a user enters a username to follow, the application effectively handles the case where no account with that username exists, the case where the account exists but is private, and the case where the user is already following that account.
- Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
    - Users can use the app at their own pace, with minimal effort.
    - Example feature: The home page shows two columns of posts instead of one, so that the user is able to view more content with minimal scrolling required.
- Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
    - Future features to implement: We want to implement the ability to resize the screen, keeping the layout of views consistent. This will allow the app to run well on any size screen, accomodating users who use significantly smaller or larger screens.

## Paragraph Aboht Target Demographic
Thanks to its flexibility and variety of content, the app can appeal to a wide range of users. 
While “foodies” are a natural core audience, it’s equally suited for people who simply want to discover restaurants in their area that match their particularly picky tastes, 
or for those who are more interested in healthy eating. Its social features also make it appealing to users who enjoy sharing experiences, connecting with like-minded people, 
and exploring new culinary trends. 
We’d market our app through social media campaigns and ads targeted at young people in major urban centers. 
According to a Forbes report, modern consumers, especially younger millennials and Gen Z—are increasingly paying for unique 
memories and events rather than material goods https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2025/01/03/travel-and-live-events-will-drive--experience-economy-growth-in-2025/.
Thus, targeting young people in cities aligns well with their preference for experiences over possessions, 
offering them the excitement of discovering new restaurants, joining in-person club events, and sharing these moments with friends. 
The urban setting also ensures that many of the experiences featured in the app are actually accessible nearby, 
which might not be the case in smaller towns.

## Paragraph About Demographics Less Likely to Use Our Product
Certain demographic groups may be less inclined or able to engage with our food-focused social media platform due to barriers related to technology 
access, lifestyle, or environment. While the program is designed to welcoming to anyone with an interest of exploring culinary experiences, it is
important to recognize that factors such as age, geographic location, and socioeconomic status can influence their app usage.

i. Elderly individuals: Seniors with limited technology knowledge would struggle navigating through the application, as they did not grow up with technology.

In developmental psychology, learning new things during early childhood can make it easier to learn new things later in life - in this case, 
learning how to use devices. These childhood experiences significantly shape brain development, particularly in areas related to learning and
memory. For the people who were introduced to computers, smartphones, and other digital interfaces early in life, adapting to the latest versions
is often easier, as modern devices build on concepts established in earlier models. In contrast, current seniors often missed those foundational
experiences, which may lead to the most basic actions (e.g. navigating menus, adjusting settings) may feel unintuitive or frustrating. As a result, 
they may be less inclined to use the app regularly or explore its full range of features.
    
ii. Rural citizens and/or poor populations: People who live in smaller or lower-income places may not be able to completely benefit from the app.

- Rural areas: Many small towns and remote regions have fewer restaurants, specialty food vendors, or food-related events compared to urban centers. This
  limits the usefulness of features like restaurant discovery, event calendars, or local meetups, as there are simply fewer listings to populate the feed.
  Regardles of whether someone in a rural area is enthusiastic about food culture, the app’s value may feel reduced, as the extent of its content is
  geographically distant. Moreover, rural communities may face slower or less reliable internet connections, making the photo-heavy, media-rich aspects of
  our platform frustrating to use.

- Economically disadvantaged areas: In lower-income communities, the barriers are twofold. First, residents may have limited access to the devices necessary
  for full participation — such as smartphones with large screens, high-speed data plans, or updated operating systems capable of running the latest app
  versions. Second, the cost of regularly exploring new restaurants, attending culinary events, or purchasing specialty foods may not be feasible. Even if
  the app inspires them with ideas, the financial means to act on those ideas may be lacking, which can lead to disengagement over time.

Furthermore, both rural and economically disadvantaged communities may have lower representation in user-generated content, since fewer residents are able 
to contribute restaurant reviews, event photos, or recommendations. This ultimately creates a feedback loop: the app becomes less relevant to these users,
which in turn makes the app’s local content even thinner.

While our platform aims to connect all food enthusiasts, certain groups such as the aformentioned may naturally engage less with our service. These
limitations stem not from a lack of interest in food culture, but from external factors like technological literacy, geographic accessibility, and
affordability. Recognizing these challenges is essential, as it allows us to address gaps in usability, and ensure that our platform remains as inclusive
and accessible as possible for diverse audiences.
